CMPUT301 Assignment 1

This application is built for Android (API 18).

The purpose of this app is to act as a Tracking app, for tracking one's fuel consumption and cost. A user can enter the date that the fuel was purchased, as well as assorted information about the fuel purchased, the odometer reading on the car, and the station the fuel was purchased at. Explicitly, the following information is prompted from the user:
Date
Odometer Reading
Station Name
Fuel Amount, Grade, and Cost per Litre

The user can add entries by supplying that information, and view all their previous entries. Additionally, the user may edit previous entries, after they have been added.
